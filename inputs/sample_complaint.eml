Dear Support Team,

I am writing to express my extreme dissatisfaction with a recent order, #ORD789012, which I received today, July 29th, 2024.

One of the items, the "Premium Blue Widget" (SKU: PBW-003), arrived severely damaged. The packaging was intact, but the widget itself is cracked and unusable. This is very disappointing as I needed this item urgently for a project.

I have attached photos of the damaged item for your review.

I request an immediate resolution to this issue. I would prefer a replacement item to be shipped via expedited delivery at your cost. If a replacement is not possible, I expect a full refund for the damaged item.

Please let me know what steps I need to take next. I expect a prompt response within 24 hours.

Order Number: ORD789012
Item: Premium Blue Widget (SKU: PBW-003)
Date of Delivery: July 29, 2024

Sincerely,

Jane Doe
